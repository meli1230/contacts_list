BRIEF OVERVIEW:
This is a short project, coded in C, that manages a contact list using a doubly linked list. The program allows you to add or remove contacts, to search contacts by name and to display all the contacts. It also includes two sorting functions, each using a different sorting algorithm. 

STRUCTURE: 
The code is structured in a main C file, and two pairs of C and header files, as it follows:

main.c 
    - this is where the program starts
    
contacts.c / contacts.h -> 
    - 

  
double linked list

initializes the list
create a contact
delete a contact
empty the list
lookup a contact
display contacts



swap function that is used by the sorting algorithms
swap contacts by name -> insertion sort function to sort the contacts by name
swap contacts by age -> bubble sort function to sort contact list by age
